# RWSUU_ThingsBoard

These are json configuration files to configure a new ThingsBoard instance to act as the web backend and frontend for the RWSUU Project

## How to configure a new ThingsBoard instance
Some familiarity with the ThingsBoard environment is required. Please visit https://thingsboard.io/docs/getting-started-guides/helloworld-pe/ for the necessary preliminary info.

Import the dashboard, rulechain, and device profile. Continue to manually create a device called "Drone" using the "Drone" Device profile. Copy the access token of the device and put it into tokens.txt like described in RWSUU_Controller. Test RWSUU_Controller and see if you get changes on the dashboard.
